## PitchUp Flutter Sample - Guitar tuning app

This app is a sample Flutter Guitar tuning app which demonstrates how to use 2 different dart libraries to implement a guitar tuning app. It also uses a library called flutter_audio_capture to capture an audio sample. 

The libraries used are: 

- https://github.com/techpotatoes/pitchup_dart: Dart library to check if a pitch is in tune for a given instrument.
- https://github.com/techpotatoes/pitch_detector_dart: Dart library to detect a pitch for a given audio sample.
